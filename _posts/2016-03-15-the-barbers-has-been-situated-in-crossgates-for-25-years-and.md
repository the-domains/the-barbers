The Barbers has been situated in Crossgates for 25 years and is owned and run by Liz.   
She has a fantastic team of girls working with her at The Barbers who are all a little bit nuts.   
The Barbers is a friendly place were both men and children are welcome from the crib to the coffin. There are plenty of things to read or toys for the kids to play with, and if you don't fancy that you could just listen to the banter while the girls work, there has yet to be a customer leave who isn't smiling.
